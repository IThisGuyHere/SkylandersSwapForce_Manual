# SkylandersSwapForce_Manual
Manual Archipelago world for Skylanders: Giants. Created by ThisGuyHere.

## Overview
*Greetings, Portal Master. The evil Lord Kaos threatens Skylands once again, but this time he is not alone. He has discoverered like-minded evildoers from other worlds, and joined forces with them in a dastardly alliance. This council of villains has fractured each of their worlds, including Skylands, and divided their pieces across the multiverse, leaving them to carry out their evil plans unimpeded. But you will not face them alone. Each of those worlds has heroes like you, and you must work with them to rebuild Skylands and stop Kaos before he obtains the ... The fate of Skylands is up to you now. Good luck.*

This manual requires a new save and at least one Skylander of each element. Any Skylanders you do not own or do not want to use should be included in the characters_to_exclude yaml option. Currently, you start with one random Skylander and the first chapter unlocked (or a random chapter; see yaml options). Depending on the chosen goal, you either need to defeat Kaos in Chapter 16 or get 3 stars on every level (essentially, complete everything). The second goal is there is you want to play with it, but I don't recommend it unless your multiworld is intended to last a month or longer.

## Required Hardware/Software

- Dolphin or another emulator that supports the Portal of Power, or a playable PC/console copy of the game. At least one Skylander from each element is manditory.
- If you are playing with linear mode disabled, you will need an existing save with all chapters unlocked but minimal other progress. If using Dolphin emulator, you can find such a save in the Releases tab with every chapter available but minimal progress on them (making a special save like the one provided for Giants is currently not possible).

## Installation Procedures

- Set up like you would any other multiworld. Place the apworld in the custom_worlds folder of the Archipelago client with all other multiworlds, place this and all other yamls in the players folder, open the Archipelago client and click Generate. A complete guide can be found in the manual Discord server <a href=https://discord.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1163846227570462820/1163846227570462820>here</a>.
- If you are using Dolphin and not playing in linear mode, download All_Chapters.bin from the releases tab and perform the following steps:
  1. Open Dolphin emulator.
  2. If you already have saves that you care about, back them up now by right-clicking the game, selecting Export\
Wii Save, and following the on-screen dialog. 
  3. From the tool bar, select Tools â†’ Import Wii Save and find the file you just downloaded. Open it and select Yes.
  4. The next time you boot up the game, you will have a fresh save on each difficulty with all chapters unlocked. 

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

Visit the manual Discord server <a href=https://discord.com/channels/1097532591650910289/1163846227570462820/1163846227570462820>here</a> and begin from step 6.



## Items
* Progressive Chapters (linear mode): The number of chapters currently available to play. **You will always start with 1**.
* Chapters (non-linear mode): Individually named chapters based on the levels in the game. **You will always start with 1**.
* Adventure Pack Levels - If enabled, unlocks the corresponding adventure pack level.
* ... Fragments (non-linear mode) - A pre-defined amount are required to fight Kaos.
* Progressive Soul Abilities - Unlocks the use of soul abilities collected in the first *n* chapters.
* Progressive Skylander Upgrades - Unlocks the ability to purchase *n* upgrades for each Skylander (or each Skylander of that element, depending on the yaml configuration).
* Skylanders - Unlocked individually or by element, depending on the yaml configuration. **You will always start with 1**.
* Active Items - Unlocks the item in question if its corresponding adventure pack is enabled.
* Luck-o-tron Wheel Slots - Each unlocks the ability to slot one luck-o-tron wheel, up to four.
* Ship Vault Key (filler) - Each allows you to open the vault in the hub's game room one time.
* Skystone Cheat (filler) - Each allows you to buy and use one skystone cheat from Auric's shop (recommended if one is too hard or rng-based).
* Lock Puzzle Key (filler) - Each allows you to buy and use one lock puzzle key from Auric's shop.

## Locations
* Completion of each base chapter (Chapter 16 may be considered "complete" when you reach the bridge to the Kaos fight).
* Completion of adventure pack chapters (if enabled).
* Hats
* Legendary Treasures
* Chests
* Soul Gems
* Winged Sapphires
* Heroic Challenges (if enabled)
* Beating a level within the listed clear time (except chapter 16)
* Arena Battles
* Skystones battles

## Traps
* Element Lock Trap - For the remainder of the level (or the next level if you are not in one), you may only use Skylanders of the same element as the one you began the level with.
* Solo Trap - You may not use any other Skylanders or active items until you beat a level or are defeated. 
* Rename Skylander Trap - Joke trap. Upon receipt, you must rename the last Skylander played using a name of the sender's choosing.
* Heavy Hitter Trap - For the remainder of the level (or the next level if you are not in one), you mmust switch the game difficulty to hard. Effect ends on level completion. If your difficulty is already hard or nightmare, pat yourself on the back.
* Reset Last Character Trap - Upon receipt, you must delete all data associated with the last Skylander used. Level, money, and upgrades are reset.
* Traps are handled a little different here than in other manuals. There is no set amount of each trap. Instead, the filler_trap_percent yaml option determines what percentage of filler items will be replaced with traps, and yaml options determine the likelihood of traps relative to one another. Let me use the default as a example:
  * By default, 50% of filler items are replaced with traps. Let's say we end up with 40 traps
  * The chance of a particular trap being selected for generation is its weight divided by the sum of all trap weights. The default weight of element lock traps is 35, and the sum of all **default** trap weights is 100. 
  * What does this mean?
    * Each trap has a 35% (35/100) chance to be an element lock trap. 
  * What does this **not** mean?
    * 35% of all traps will be element lock traps
    * there will be 35 element lock traps
  * Do not set all trap weights to 0. Something very bad will happen if you do.

## Additional Notes for Non-Linear Mode
The provided save for non-linear mode was created using leaked debug tools. Those tools trick the game into thinking that every level but the last is complete, but do not collect any items or check off any level progress. As such, you may end up playing a level that expects you to have some item collected from a previous chapter. The biggest example is skystones. Until you beat a skystones match, your deck will be comprised of five Drow Lancemasters. Some battles are impossible to beat with this deck, and many others are extremely difficult. The best workaround is to immediately challenge Dreadbeard in the game room to get your starter deck and a couple of decent stones.

## Ideas for the Future
* Persephone (upgrade fairy) as an item?
* pacifist trap (only kill necessary enemies on next level and restart if you fail)
* I don't want to add story scrolls because you rarely have to stray from the main path to get them. In my opinion, most collectable locations should require *some* effort to reach, and there are too many locations right now anyway
